How to read code?

Stick to the path

Donâ€™t try to read code linearly as it appears in scripts. Read it in the order of execution, starting from obvious entry points. If a library provides instructions on how to carry out certain tasks, for example, start from the function calls that are specified, and work through what happens from there.
