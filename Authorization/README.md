# Authorization


## Authentication vs Authorization
 if the authenticating system can verify that the shared secret was presented correctly, the user is considered authenticated. Authorization, by contrast, is the mechanism by which a system determines what level of access a particular authenticated user should have to secured resources controlled by the system.


**Authentication**
process of defining an identity and the verification of that identity

**Authorization**
Determines what an identity can access within a system once it's been authenticated to it

**Access Control**
The method and process of how access is granted to a secure resource.
