- Users 
- Roles  (admin, developer, tester, hr etc)
- Rights (/changeconfig, /removeemployee etc )

### Mappings 
```
Users mapped to Roles
Roles mapped to Rights  - (Policy)
Rights - Resources access rights. (which resources can be accessed)
```

- New employee should be able to activate the desired role.
