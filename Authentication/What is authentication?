What is Authentication?
Authentication is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity. In contrast with identification, which refers to the act of stating or otherwise indicating a claim purportedly attesting to a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of actually confirming that identity. (Wikipedia) 


What is Secret Based Authentication?
In secret-based authentication, parties agree that a secret (S) represents the public identity of a prover (P). When P wants to prove he/she actually is P, all he/she needs to do is to supply S as his/her secret to the second party â€“ verifier (V). Whatever the authentication method is, general methodology is the same: 

The prover sends his/her identity (P) and a secret (S(P)) (for example, login/password pair). 
The verifier tries to match S(P) with the records in the credential database. 
For any secret-based authentication, it is important that the parties have a pre-shared secret.
