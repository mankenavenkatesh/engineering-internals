What does end-to-end encryption mean?
- In end-to-end encryption, only the data is encrypted. The headers, trailers, and routing information are not encrypted. End-to-to end encryption in Whatsapp has been developed in collaboration with ‘Open Whisper Systems.’

End-to-end encryption makes sure that a message that is sent is received only by the intended recipient and none other. Whatsapp has ensured, that even “it” cannot read the messages bolstering a very strong messaging platform. It also means that outsiders or third party individuals cannot snoop on conversations between intended recipients as well.
