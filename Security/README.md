Digital Certificate
- way to map publicKey with the owner identity. 

What does end-to-end encryption mean?
- In end-to-end encryption, only the data is encrypted. The headers, trailers, and routing information are not encrypted. End-to-to end encryption in Whatsapp has been developed in collaboration with ‘Open Whisper Systems.’

End-to-end encryption makes sure that a message that is sent is received only by the intended recipient and none other. Whatsapp has ensured, that even “it” cannot read the messages bolstering a very strong messaging platform. It also means that outsiders or third party individuals cannot snoop on conversations between intended recipients as well.

PGP encryption
- how to ensure public key belongs to a user?
- "web of trust"
- if multiple people endorse the identity, trust the identity. 

Trusting the public keys
Digital signatures help mitigate sophisticated attacks, but how can a sender know that the public key they’re using belongs to the person they think it does? After all, the server could easily give a bogus public key to the sender.

To solve this problem, we introduced Address Verification, which allows you to share your public key and digitally sign the public keys of others that you have personally verified. These trusted public keys are then securely stored in your encrypted contacts.

Additionally, we’re working on a project called Key Transparency. It will automatically verify the public key of each recipient you send email to, without requiring any manual action. We’ll publish a blog post with more details about this feature once it’s ready.
