How to read code?

Stick to the path

Donâ€™t try to read code linearly as it appears in scripts. Read it in the order of execution, starting from obvious entry points. If a library provides instructions on how to carry out certain tasks, for example, start from the function calls that are specified, and work through what happens from there.


The point is that if you want to make sense of code without tearing your hair out, you need to read it in the order in which it will be processed.
