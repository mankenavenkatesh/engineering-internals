# Use Case
The owner of a large multi-stored building wants to have a computerized fire
alarm system for his building. Smoke detectors and fire alarms would be placed
in each room of the building. The fire alarm system would monitor the status of
these smoke detectors. Whenever a fire condition is reported by any of the
smoke detectors, the fire alarm system should determine the location at which
the fire condition is reported by any of the smoke detectors, the fire alarm system
should determine the location at which the fire condition has occurred and then
sound the alarms only in the neighboring locations. The fire alarm system should
also flash an alarm message on the computer console. Fire fighting personnel
man the console round the clock. After a fire condition has been successfully
handled, the fire alarm system should support resetting the alarms by the fire
fighting personnel.
