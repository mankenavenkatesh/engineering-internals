# Low level design
### How to approach LowLevelDesign problem?
- Gather requirements.
- convert them in functions. 
- choose one or either of below approaches and come with respective design.


## Object oriented approach
- come up with class diagram for a given module.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram

- club functionalities of a module to create classes. Based on functionalities or methods of a class, add attributes
- the basic abstraction are realworld entities such as employee, picture, machine, radar system, etc.
- " identify nouns "

## Functional approach
- divide functionalities of a module to sub functionalities. 
- the basic abstraction are real-world functions such as sort, display, track, etc,
- " identify verbs "


## Difference between Function Oriented and Object Oriented Design

## How to choose which approach to follow?
- Even though object-oriented and function-oriented approaches are
remarkably different approaches to software design, yet they do not replace each other but complement each other in some sense. 

- For example, usually we generally apply the top-down function-oriented techniques to design the internal methods
of a class, once the classes are identified.
